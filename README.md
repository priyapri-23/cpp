🧩 Sudoku Solver in C++
A command-line program written in C++ that solves any valid 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. This project demonstrates clean algorithmic logic, recursion, and handling constraint-based problems efficiently.

✨ Features
🧠 Uses depth-first search with backtracking

📦 Accepts puzzle input via 2D array (or you can extend it for file input)

🚀 Solves puzzles in real time with clear output formatting

🔍 Validates Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3×3 grid constraints)

📂 File Structure
Sudoku_Solver.cpp     // Contains the full logic and execution

🏨 Hotel Management System (C++)
A console-based hotel management system built in C++ that allows users to simulate hotel operations such as room booking, food ordering, and sales tracking. This project demonstrates control flow, user input handling, and basic inventory management—all within a single file.

✨ Features
🛏️ Room booking with availability check

🍝 Food ordering (Pasta, Pizza, Burger, Sandwich)

📊 Summary of total sales and remaining stock

🧠 Menu-driven interface using switch-case logic

📂 File Structure
Hotel_Mgmt.cpp   // Main program file

Follow the on-screen menu to book rooms, order food, or view sales reports.

> You can customize item prices or expand the menu by modifying the switch cases in the code.

💡 Concepts Demonstrated
Conditional logic (if-else, switch)

Looping (while)

Input/output handling

Basic inventory and sales tracking
